# Brazil Forest Fires 2018
The Amazon rainforest is the world's largest tropical rainforest. Something people have been saying to bring attention to why we should care about the deforestation and forest fires is that "One in five breaths we take comes from the Amazon". The point is, the Amazon is important and must be protected seeing as how it's being threatened.

## App
The app in development is a Shiny app. With a focus on spacial visualization, the app will use ggspacial to create various visualizations of the amount of forest fires in different regions at various times.

## Execution
For those unfamiliar with Shiny apps, you can either open a local version by clicking "Run App" in the top right hand corner of RStudio's editor or call runApp("directory-app.R-is-in-relative-to-wd/absolute-path"). I will create a dependencies file so that you can install all the packages I used without needing to be prompted (if you don't already have them).

## Visualization
This will not be my first Shiny app, but will certainly be a good exercise for visualizing spatial data, as well as using other graphs to compare the impact in different regions.
